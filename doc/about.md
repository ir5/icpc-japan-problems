# ICPC Japan Problems

This is a collective archive of problems presented in ICPC Japanese regional contests and ICPC-JAG practice contests, with unofficially estimated difficulties.

The main objective of the site is to motivate participants of ICPC to engage in daily practice.



## Points

The difficulty of problems is represented as points, which are estimated based on the number of teams that solved the problem during the actual contest. Since the number of participating teams varies across contests, it is adjusted to a fixed number for comparison purposes.

For problems that were created before 2013, the points are adjusted according to the difficulty evaluated in [AOJ-ICPC](http://aoj-icpc.ichyo.jp/) instead.

Points are represented as Fibonacci numbers to introduce an exponential scoring system. An emoji (color) is associated with each problem for visual assistance. This does not reflect evaluations on specific contest sites.

### Domestic contests

Points are classified as follows. For domestic contests, the number of participating teams is assumed to be 400.
